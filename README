This is the our logger setup (/lager, gitit?)
It consist of two simple, configurable components:
1.
	An nginx configuration (~/default) that:
		*Allows CORS quite freely and
		*Logs certain request data, such as certain url parameters, to
		 the log file (/var/log/nginx/access.log)

2.
	A logrotate script (~/nginx) that manages the rotation of the access.log
	file.
